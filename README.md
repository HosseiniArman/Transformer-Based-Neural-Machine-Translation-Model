# Transformer-Based-Neural-Machine-Translation-Model
The model is capable of processing input sequences, applying attention mechanisms, and generating output sequences for tasks like machine translation.



## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of the Transformer architecture to build a Neural Machine Translation model. The code includes detailed implementation of the Encoder, Decoder, and attention mechanisms, making it a comprehensive guide to understanding how Transformer models work.

### Self-Attention Mechanism
The Self-Attention mechanism allows each token in a sequence to focus on other tokens when generating its output. Instead of processing tokens in isolation, self-attention computes a weighted sum of the other tokens in the sequence, making it possible for the model to capture relationships between words, regardless of their distance in the sequence. This process helps the Transformer model understand contextual dependencies more effectively than traditional sequence models like RNNs or LSTMs.
## Model Architecture

The model consists of:

- **Positional Encoding**: Introduced to add positional information to the input sequences.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Each token in the sequence attends to every other token.
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Fully connected layers are used after attention blocks.
- **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: Ensuring gradient stability and convergence.
## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to implement a Transformer-based model for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The model aims to translate input sequences into target sequences using self-attention and positional encoding mechanisms.

## Requirements

To run the code, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib transformers numpy
